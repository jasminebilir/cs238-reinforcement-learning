# cs238-reinforcement-learning
Reinforcement learning investigation of SARSA, Q-Learning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for Minesweeper with Markov Decision Processes 

WINTER 2023

A project originally used for the CS 238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty final project. The project investigated reinforcement learning and policy search on the game Minesweeper. Experiments included investigations into SARA, Q-Learning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms and implementations. Pair-Programmed code can be found at https://github.com/benjaminhwittenbrink/cs238project

Topics covered and tools used: 
  - Reinforment Learning
  - Large State Space Representation
  - Markov Decision Processes
  - Q-Search
  - SARSA
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search
  - Exploitation vs Exploration
